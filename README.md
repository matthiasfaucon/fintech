## Information

### Google Trends API Error

If you come across an infinite loader or encounter errors within the app, it could be a result of reaching the token limit for the Google Trends API. 

It's essential to place this token in a .env file, particularly when opting for the premium plan.

### Tests Directory in the Back-end

This directory provides examples of the different libraries and APIs used in the app.

### v2 Directory in the Back-end

The libraries and APIs in this directory can be utilized for potential upgrades to the app. We are considering integrating the Twitter API as well, but please note that accessing the API via GET requests requires a premium plan.
